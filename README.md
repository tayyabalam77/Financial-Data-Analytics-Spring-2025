#  FDA Spring 2025 – Course Progress

This repository tracks my progress, assignments, and projects in the **Financial Data Analytics (FDA)** course offered in Spring 2025.

##  Repository Structure

- [`assignments/`](./assignments): Assignment submissions covering regression, fraud detection, and customer segmentation.
- [`Programming_Quizzes/`](./Programming_Quizzes): Timed assessments testing Python fundamentals and ML implementation.
- [`Midterm_Kaggle_Project/`](./Midterm_Kaggle_Project): Mid-semester Kaggle competition modeling and leaderboard analysis.
- [`Final_Project/`](./Final_Project): Final course project, replicating and extending Nova Credit’s alternative credit scoring approach.

##  Assignments

- **Assignment 1:** Linear regression and multiple linear regression to predict salary and startup profit.
- **Assignment 2:** Logistic regression and class imbalance handling to detect insurance fraud (Shift Technology case).
- **Assignment 3:** K-Means clustering and feature engineering for HSBC customer segmentation (HBS ST138 case study).

 All files and results are available in the [`assignments/`](./assignments) folder.

##  Programming Quizzes

- **Quiz 1:** Kaggle Machine Learning Challenge — 1 hour, 3 submissions, leaderboard-based scoring.
- **Quiz 4:** Python fundamentals in Jupyter (conditions, loops, functions, NumPy, Pandas).

 Detailed submissions and explanations are in the [`Programming_Quizzes/`](./Programming_Quizzes) folder.

##  Final Project

- Built a machine learning system to replicate **Nova Credit’s** cross-border credit scoring.
- Proposed a Pakistan-specific startup called **CreditDekho**, combining telecom and government data to extend credit access.
- Conducted forecasting, customer scoring, and evaluated classification models.

 Project files and final report are in the [`Final_Project/`](./Final_Project) folder.
