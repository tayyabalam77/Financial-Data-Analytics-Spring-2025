## ðŸ“‚ List of Assignments

### **Assignment 1: Linear & Multiple Regression**
This assignment had **three subparts**, each involving a different regression task:
1. **Linear Regression â€“ Salary Prediction**
   - Predicted salary based on years of experience
   - Learned about coefficient interpretation, overfitting, and train-test split
2. **Multiple Linear Regression â€“ Startup Profit**
   - Predicted startup profit using R&D, Marketing, and Admin spend
   - Learned feature importance, correlation matrix analysis, and impact of removing irrelevant features
3. **Student Regression Task**
   - Solved a practical regression problem involving student data
   - Explored non-linearity, outlier handling, and interpretation issues in real-world datasets

### **Assignment 2: Logistic Regression for Fraud Detection**
- **Topic**: Binary classification, handling class imbalance, regularization
- **Case**: Insurance fraud classification
- **Techniques Used**:
  - SMOTE, undersampling, cost-sensitive learning
  - Feature engineering: ClaimAgeRatio, ClaimAmountPerPolicy
  - Threshold tuning, confusion matrix analysis
- **Learned**:
  - Precision vs. Recall trade-off in fraud models
  - Why accuracy alone is misleading in imbalanced datasets
  - How regularization and business knowledge improve interpretability
